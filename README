Algorithm::Pair::Swiss version 0.12
====================

This module was created as an alternative for Algorithm::Pair::Best,
which probably offers more control over the pairings, in particular
regarding ensuring the highest overal quality of pairings.
Algorithm::Pair::Swiss is sort of dumb in this regard, but uses a
slightly more intuitive interface.
